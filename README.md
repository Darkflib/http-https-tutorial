I apologise in advance for stealing of image content... this was thrown together in a hurry.


## Introduction

While discussing some issues that we were having on a cluster, we noticed that some of the team were lacking in a deeper understanding of how stuff works under-the-hood.

Hopefully, this quick and dirty primer should assist in getting people up to speed, or filling in the blanks.

## The Web

I assume that you know what the web is. You might have gone to google multiple times today already, checked your webmail or even started an incognito session for [reasons].

What underlies the web is a set of protocols/specifications - HTML, HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, TCP/IP, TLS and many many more.

I will try to show you how these fit together in the following sections.


## HTML

Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML for short, is at its' core simply a text file with some conversions about how certain things are written.

For example, the following is a valid but simple html document.

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title> Hello World </title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1> This is a first level heading</h1>
    <p> This is a paragraph </p>
  </body>
</html>
```
